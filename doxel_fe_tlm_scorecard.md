Looking for an Tech Lead/Manager who is, or _can rapidly become_...

(note: it's impossible for one person to be a 5 on all of these. That is not the expectation. The expectation is that this rubric helps interviewers get real data so they can score 1-5 on each item instead of being wishy-washy in feedback. That said, this is an _ordered list_ - #1 is more important than, #2, #3â€¦) 

1.  Front End Technical Expert
    1. Has built multiple, complex Web Front Ends. Comfortable in JS and UI best practices. Can talk your ears off about the pros/cons of various frameworks. 
    2. Has deep experience in BE technologies to power FEs in Python/Ruby/Java/etc. Can speak intelligently about API approaches, database schemas, language choices, FE vs BE responsibilities...
    3. Data-driven. Knows what kind of customer metrics to track and how to interpret them. Makes technical decisions based off of real data. Loves building data visualizations. Bonus points for being an Edward Tufte fan. 
    4. Production expertise. Knows how to manage systems in production so they have a high level of reliability and performance. Ideally intimately familiar with Docker and Kubernetes. 
    5. Quick learner. Can pick up new technologies, tools, etc and integrate them into their team and codebase.
2. Extraordinary executor
    1. Has shipped reasonably complex projects on time with small teams. Lives the agile mindset and iterates very quickly by interacting with Product, Design, and other stakeholders. Has scars to prove it.
    2. Can identify various processes used to keep projects on track, identify risks and long-poles, and trade-off features/quality/deadlines. Has good nuance on over-process vs under-process. Does not micromanage, or under-manage.
    3. Generates healthy pressure from internal motivation. Bias toward action and clearly gets excited about impact. Absorbs and redistributes pressure from organization correctly (not too much, not too little). 
    4. Experience with startup velocity and tradeoffs. Demonstrated business-value vs. engineering-need trade-off evaluation. Has a knack for finding shortcuts that speed up the business without too much technical debt.
    5. Intuitively understands #Winning and #IncreasingCapacityToWin. Chronically discontent and wants to move faster. Focuses on impact, business-value, and continually figuring out how to move faster/build more leverage. Strong decision maker with right amount of consensus-building.
3. Product Leader
    1. Significant experience working directly with customers to understand their needs. Can translate engineering speak to cutomer speak and back flawlessly.
    2. Interfaces well with Product and Design, helping them improve their own work using his engineering expertise. Understands the domain almost as well as Product Managers.
    3. Comfortable representing the engineering team in executive meetings and customer meetings. Can tie the day-to-day work their team is doing to the overall company goals flawlessly.
    4. Not afraid of debate and conflict. "Obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly"
    5. Great eye for product experience. Can put on a Designer hat if needed. Familiar with UX concepts, best practices, and experimentation loops.
4. Top-shelf team & talent producer
    1. Builds high-performing teams. Can tell the difference between average teams and really good teams. Has 'better-than-random' approaches to building high-performing teams. Has done this multiple times (preferably >2).
    2. Can build a team from scratch (0-5 in <6 months). Understands the risks of rapid growth and has techniques to mitigate. 
    3. Talent farmer: track record of growing Sr+ engineers (bonus: Staff+ engineers). Has frameworks for identifying strengths/weaknesses, can reason about career growth intelligently, and has demonstrated wide range of tools used in growing talent.
    4. Talent magnet: track record of attracting Sr+ engineers (bonus: Staff+ engineers). Can quickly identify strength of engineer + fit on the team. Excellent top-grader and can accurately paint the team, their company, and the opportunity in ways that attract candidates without setting false expectations.
    5. Poor-performer weeder. Track record of identifying poor performers and removing them from the organization. Does this with grace and correct amount of doing-right by the employee while moving fast enough for the business.
    6. Bonus points if has accomplished ^^^ with a primarily remote-first team. COVID and all...
