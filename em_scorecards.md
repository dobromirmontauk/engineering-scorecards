<h1>Twitter Ad Serving</h1>


We will grade every sub-bullet on a 1-5 scale:



1. Candidate cannot do this now, and unlikely to learn in <6 months.
2. Candidate cannot do this now but likely to learn in <6 months.
3. Candidate has some experience doing this, or will be adequate in <1 month.
4. Candidate seems quite strong at this.
5. Candidate is stellar at this.

Looking for an Engineering Manager who is, or _can rapidly become_…

(note: it's impossible for one person to be a 5 at all of these. That is not the expectation. The expectation is that this rubric helps interviewers get real data so they can score 1-5 on each item instead of being wishy-washy in feedback. That said, this is an _ordered list_ - #1 is more important than, #2, #3…)



1. Top-shelf team & talent producer
    1. Builds high-performing teams. Can tell the difference between average teams and really good teams. Has 'better-than-random' approaches to building high-performing teams. Has done this multiple times (preferably >5).
    2. Can manage through extreme team growth (2-3x in <12 months). Understands the risks of rapid growth and has techniques to mitigate. 
    3. Can manage through extreme attrition (40%/year). Has tools to mitigate the damage to the team. Can quickly identify at-risk engineers and lower attrition probabilities. Understands the root cause of attrition.
    4. Talent farmer: track record of growing Staff engineers (bonus: Sr. Staff+ engineers). Has frameworks for identifying strengths/weaknesses, can reason about career growth intelligently, and has demonstrated wide range of tools used in growing talent.
    5. Talent magnet: track record of attracting Sr+ engineers (bonus: Staff+ engineers). Can quickly identify strength of engineer + fit on the team. Excellent top-grader and can accurately paint the team, Twitter, and the opportunity in ways that attract candidates without setting false expectations.
    6. Poor-performer weeder. Track record of identifying poor performers and removing them from the organization. Does this with grace and correct amount of doing-right by the employee.
2. Extraordinary executor
    1. Has shipped reasonably large projects on time: 6+ months with 10+ engineers, cross-organization (bonus: cross company). Can intelligently talk about the lifecycle of such sized projects.
    2. Can identify various processes used to keep projects on track, identify risks and long-poles, and trade-off features/quality/deadlines. Has good nuance on over-process vs under-process. Aligned on OKRs, project planning, etc with Twitter approaches. Does not micromanage, or under-manage.
    3. Generates healthy pressure from internal motivation. Bias toward action and clearly gets excited about impact. Absorbs and redistributes pressure from organization correctly (not too much, not too little). 
    4. Experience with rebuilding large systems (100K-1M+ LOC over 12-24 months). Can explain when a rewrite is necessary vs a refactor. Demonstrated business-value vs. engineering-need trade-off evaluation.
    5. Intuitively understands #Winning and #IncreasingCapacityToWin. Chronically discontent and wants to move faster. Focuses on impact, business-value, and continually figuring out how to move faster/build more leverage. 
3. Large organization leader and team player
    1. Effectively works in large organizations with varied partners: hardware engineering, Platform engineering, legal, sales, marketing, #Goldbird peer teams. Builds strong relationships and trust across 20+ teams.
    2. Customer obsession. Listens to customers and figures out how to solve their real problems. "Work vigorously to earn and keep the trust."
    3. Chronically discontent with the organization. Owner of #Goldbird and Twitter - everything is their problem and they prioritize and tackle the most important things first. Has their head screwed-on tight: they know why they are here and what they are doing. Not passive; actively moving something forward.
    4. Learns very quickly and then teaches the people around them. Raises the organization's bar. Becomes an expert and spreads that expertise widely. 
    5. Extremely personal growth-oriented. Takes feedback very well and track-record of changing themselves to fit the role/situational needs.
    6. Not afraid of debate and conflict. "Obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly" 
4. Distributed systems expert
    1. Loves building complex distributed systems. Gets a real kick of of the hard problems. Can challenge experts, and thus identify great talent for the team. Infectious enthusiasm that generates respect from the team and motivates them - as well as candidates.
    2. Deep production experience. Has opinions on what 'healthy' systems look like and can quickly determine if a particular system qualifies. Comfortable being responsible for mission-critical systems ($XB and 24/7 oncall). 
    3. Strong nose for quality software and able to call out code- and system-smells quickly. Does not unnecessarily sacrifice quality and excellent judgement on hard-to-pay-off debt vs cheap technical debt. 
    4. Comfortable managing a $5M/month hardware budget, including capacity planning, resource allocation, customer negotiation, and identifying unnecessary spend.
    5. Thinks big. Willing to take long-term bets and do real Research & Development, with a portfolio approach. Knows how to fail-fast and also challenge ideas that are too incremental.
    6. Bonus: track record of publications/blog posts, OSS, etc.
