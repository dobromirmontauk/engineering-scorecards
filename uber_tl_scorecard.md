<h1>Über Tech Lead</h1>


An über-TL is the Last Line of Defense for sane system architecture and engineering processes.

Even with strong Tech Leads a complex system will degenerate into a tangled dependency graph where even ownership can no longer be determined. If you've ever worked in an organization that has three ways to release a binary or six different testing patterns (and, of course, no actual end-to-end testing process) - you're suffering from the lack of an über-TL. The most important aspect of an ÜTL is that _they care deeply about sane architecture and the 3-5 year maintainability of their system._ ÜTLs have a supernatural skill at convincing harried TLs, FLs, PMs, and EMs to weave short-term decisions into a beautiful long-term system. They figure out how to hide the messiness of the real world behind beautiful abstractions. An über-TL is an [architect](https://www.google.com/search?q=architecture&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi6-MPus67UAhVH3WMKHVSgBkMQ_AUICygC&biw=1920&bih=983).

Ergo, über-TLs require an immense amount of IQ and EQ. They are a rare breed. Don't plan on becoming a ÜTL in your career; you may get there someday but it's not something you can really work towards. I've met just a handful in my career.

Über-TL roles last for multiple years as they require deep understanding of the current system and a multi-year vision of where the architecture should go.

<h2>How to use this scorecard</h2>

To get the most out of this document you should _score yourself_ on each item, and give yourself a min/max/average on each dimension. Then, ask your manager to do the same - and maybe peers too. See if they grade you close to how you grade yourself. The goal is to help you go through the [learning cycle](http://www.cala.fsu.edu/modules/assessing_knowledge): ignorance → declarative → procedural → mastery. 

Make a copy of this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PX61irzc6eCxgl2tzEzE6aKF92l7EoHcVac7Nb1Beko/edit#gid=0) and use the following rating scale:


*   1 - You’re not doing this and aren’t likely to in the future.
*   2 - You have significant areas where you need to improve.
*   3 - You do this well.
*   4 - You do this amazingly — keep it up.
*   5 - OMG how do you do this so well???

<h2>How your organization judges you:</h2>

1. **_Leader: You lead by influence, not by fiat_**
    1. You set the _direction_ on where our **_technology_** needs to end up in 2-5 years, by deeply understanding all the business constraints.
    2. You _align_ your engineering teams, partners, and stakeholders to your direction.
    3. You get _commitments_ from your engineers, partners, and stakeholders to execute on your vision.
    4. You are a magnet for other Staff+ level people. They want to join your team because of your vision/execution/impact.
    5. You consistently grow engineering leaders (TLs + EMs), teaching them how to set _direction_, grow _alignment_, and get _commitments_ within their own scope of work.
2. **_Developer: you are a kick-ass developer everyone wants on their team_**
    1. You are actively contributing code (>30%). When coding, you are a top producer.
    2. You are in the weeds on the most important technical challenges of the organization.
    3. You consistently grow engineers technically through code reviews, design reviews, postmortems, and 1:1 mentoring.
    4. You regularly find inspiration for system-wide improvements by working directly in the code. You see the forest by walking through the trees.
    5. You understand all the tools your team uses deeply. You have arcane knowledge about the language, the operating systems, the frameworks that reflect years of use and thinking.
3. **_Systems Focused: You know engineering is more than the sum of the written code_**
    1. You are the expert in the inputs and outputs of your architecture and the nuances of design tradeoffs taken historically.
    2. You are aware of, and approve of, all the changes happening to the architecture (planned or unplanned). Approval can be delegated (this is encouraged).
    3. You consider all the dimensions of a well-run system: cost, scale, reliability, latency, throughput, iteration speed, flexibility, solid documentation, clean APIs...
    4. You proactively work with TLs to improve cross-organization processes like testing, monitoring, debugging, logging, release engineering, QA.
    5. You proactively work with PMs and the rest of the business to improve cross-functional processes like Sprints, Design Reviews (Design/Product/Eng), Retros, etc.
4. **_Entrepreneur: You demonstrate great judgement in product versus technology tradeoffs_**
    1. You deeply believe that sometimes the best engineering solution is one that involves no engineering work. You find opportunities to shortcut projects, or skip them entirely, while still meeting customer needs.
    2. You understand the customer's needs deeply. You can predict what their needs will be in 3-5 years and you can explain in detail why your architecture will adapt seamlessly with the customer's needs.
    3. Your architecture decisions weigh the cost versus benefits intelligently.
    4. You understand the key metrics that should drive the decisions in your architecture and the data pipelines that produce those metrics. You bias toward looking at the data to reach your own conclusions.
    5. You set a standard that is copied by the rest of your team. Engineers review their own work knowing the questions you will ask.
5. **_Strategic Technologist: you focus on solving future problems, today_**
    1. You design leverageable/reusable architecture. Your designs withstand the test of time.
    2. You keep abreast of technological changes in the industry. You test and introduce new technologies into the organization successfully. 
    3. You are an ambassador to partner engineering teams and influence their long-term roadmaps (1-3 years) in the best interest of your team and the company. These include (not limited to): SRE, QA, platform teams we depend on, clients of our systems, data center/hardware teams, etc.
    4. You have a crazy, creative way of solving problems that few others can match. Some would call it brilliant.
    5. You can see the future. In fact, you watched a replay of it last weekend.
6. **_Communicator_**
    1. You are an information router who connects people who need to talk to each other. You regularly save the organization from duplicate work and unnecessary headaches.
    2. You represent the engineering team to the rest of the company, especially non-technical partners (sales/marketing/legal/finance/etc).
    3. You educate VP/Director/senior EMs and PMs on the technical challenges that the organization faces. You partner with them to make the best staffing and priority decisions for the organization and company.
    4. You **write things down**. Your documents are top-notch and stand on their own legs, no explanation/conversation required. They withstand the test of time and are updated as necessary to be the Source of Truth. 
    5. You wield all the communication tools (Slack, email, JIRA, TDDs, etc) flawlessly for maximum leverage. You seem to be everywhere at all times; other engineers assume you are reading everything they write and improve their own communication in response.
