<h1>Feature Lead Scorecard</h1>


A Feature Lead is the Directly Responsible Individual for launching a feature/project on time.

Feature Lead roles last for weeks-to-quarters, depending on the size/scope of the project.

Feature Lead roles are designed to provide **tension** with the [Technical Lead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17MAjqK2ybnzp4gUSZaVJhez0aH6o-B-tjFXtwlnJ_aU/edit#) roles. Feature Leads want to ship; Technical Leads want to build the Right Thing the Right Way. This tension should be healthy, inspiring debate and resulting in the best decision for the business (trading off short-term vs long-term needs).

<h2>How to use this scorecard</h2>


To get the most out of this document you should _score yourself_ on each item, and give yourself a min/max/average on each dimension. Then, ask your manager to do the same - and maybe peers too. See if they grade you close to how you grade yourself. The goal is to help you go through the [learning cycle](http://www.cala.fsu.edu/modules/assessing_knowledge): ignorance → declarative → procedural → mastery. 

Make a copy of this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PX61irzc6eCxgl2tzEzE6aKF92l7EoHcVac7Nb1Beko/edit#gid=0) and use the following rating scale:



*   1 - You’re not doing this and aren’t likely to in the future.
*   2 - You have significant areas where you need to improve.
*   3 - You do this well.
*   4 - You do this amazingly — keep it up.
*   5 - OMG how do you do this so well???

<h2>How your manager judges you:</h2>




1. **_Execution: you make commitments and you consistently hit them_**
    1. You have a plan. It's aggressive but realistic, with unambiguous goals, and approved by the relevant experts/stakeholders. It's also flexible: you consciously update your plan as you learn or the world changes around you. You commit to specific dates in your plan, and you regularly hit them. You have a magical ability to see around corners.
    2. You (and your team!) are always aware of the critical path to launch and are actively mitigating the risk. Dependencies on other teams are well-understood - and they understand what you expect of them.
    3. You optimize for low-latency. You are comfortable burning engineering hours, if it makes sense, to de-risk a milestone, prove product/market fit, or hit an important customer commitment.
    4. You deeply understand the Feature Requirements (owned by PMs) and are able to make appropriate engineering/product tradeoffs. You intelligently negotiate requirements (scope/deadlines/prioritization/tech-debt) based on engineering cost vs product value. You are the final decider on _what_ gets built _when_. 
    5. Your launches are smooth. The product works, the support cost on you and partner teams is low, and customers are happy. You intelligently tradeoff before-launch work and after launch-work - and you actually do the after-launch cleanup!
2. **_Ownership: you are the undisputed expert of your product_**
    1. You can reason through complex scenarios to **predict how your product will behave**. If small, you know exactly where to find the code that might be causing that strange behavior; if large, you know whom to ask to quickly build your own intuition. You use this to save the organization headaches and help your PM make accurate, off-the-cuff estimates.
    2. You don't let team, organization, language, system, or any other boundaries impede your progress. If it touches your product, you go learn how it works and how to modify it. 
    3. You understand all the metrics that matter for your product and you regularly ask insightful questions and find surprising answers. You care deeply about data and put significant effort into gathering it, cleaning it, querying it, and using it to make good decisions. You know _first_ when the numbers don't look good and you already have ideas on how to fix the root cause.
    4. You leave your product in a solid state after launch. Debt is paid off, documentation cleaned up, and permanent owners identified/ramped up. Iterative improvements to your product continue. Your product does not wither and die. If it needs killing, you humanely decommission it and remove all traces so years later engineers aren’t tripping over the carcass.
    5. You take full responsibility for everything related to your feature - every bug, outage, or unhappy customer. No excuses. 
3. **_Customer Obsession: your effective partnership with PM levels-up our customer focus  _**
    1. You know who your customers are and you evangelize their problems, needs, and vocabulary within your team. All members understand the bigger picture and the role of your project/team within it.
    2. You understand the customer problems deeply enough to hold your own in a debate. You can predict what your customers will need and you use this to build technology that grows with them.
    3. You are an effective partner to, and proxy for, your PM. You speak the same language and have the same vision. You complement each other naturally: s/he has breadth, you have depth; s/he can focus on long-term while you handle the short-term details. You help them find low-hanging product fruit through your technical expertise.
    4. You know when to accept technical debt for the sake of the customer and you pay it down at the right moment. You honor organizational commitments made to the customer.
    5. You escalate product requirements when they are unclear or not in the _overall _best interest of your customers/users.
4. **_Leadership: sometimes engineering is more about people than about writing code…_**
    1. You create positive pressure to ship. You help engineers see the _why_ so they put in maximum energy on the _what_ and the _how_. You have an intensity that is hard to describe and it energizes the people around you.
    2. You know how to communicate perfectly: the message, the medium, the audience, the timing. Your stakeholders always know the project's status and tradeoffs chosen. Your partners/dependencies always know what you need from them and keep your requirements top-of-mind. Your leadership chain always knows the project's risks and how they can help accelerate you, if they so choose.
    3. You keep the wheels greased. You have healthy relationships with all your partner teams, Tech Leads, dependencies, etc. Your project is never delayed because you get incorrectly blocked by external factors.
    4. You escalate when appropriate: bad technical decisions, poor work quality, inappropriate workload, unreasonable technical debt, etc. 
    5. You regularly discuss flaws/friction with Tech Leads based on your experience working in their systems. They always have your needs top-of-mind when making design and prioritization decisions. You drive improvements in the overall technical stack through your unique combination of product awareness, people leadership, and technical strength.
5. **_Inspirational: you get your engineering team excited about the work_**
    1. You live and breathe your product. Your enthusiasm is infectious and you spread it actively through demos, celebrations, customer stories, etc.
    2. You are a talent magnet. People seek you out to work with you, your team, and specifically the feature you are building. You understand that talent comes in many shapes and sizes and you know how to leverage them all: 20% time, sub-delegation to another person/team, temporary allocation, or even permanent moves. In all cases, you help your recruits become part of the team.
    3. You build a team of owners, not contractors. Your engineers care about the product they are building. Your team regularly ships ideas that came _from the team_. 
    4. You build a [Level 4 Tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_Leadership): the team has fun, loves what they do, and may be friends forever. 
    5. You don’t burn yourself or your team out. You can keep an impressive pace for years.
6. **_Engineering: your coding and system design skills accelerate the project 10x_**
    1. You have a rare talent for understanding foreign codebases, languages, and systems. You have no fear and just jump in wherever you are needed to make progress. You’re a full-stack developer productive in many technologies and frameworks. You regularly de-risk critical pieces of the project.
    2. You push for high-quality designs yet are realistic about business needs. You weave your feature across all the required systems in a logical way, without (permanently) hacking up any piece. 
    3. You identify missing platforms for your feature (i.e. re-usable components) and you work with appropriate long-term owners to either build them, or to take over ownership of your short-term workaround.
    4. You raise technical hurdles with the appropriate Tech Leads and drive towards the best end-to-end technical solution that meets the business's short-term and long-term needs. 
    5. You take pride in high-quality engineering. You ensure your product has adequate test coverage, scales as necessary, isn’t unnecessarily expensive, is easy to debug, and will be easy to maintain for years.
