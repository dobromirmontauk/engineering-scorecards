<h2>Doxel ML Tech Lead / Manager </h2>

We will grade every sub-bullet on a 1-5 scale:

1. Candidate cannot do this now, and unlikely to learn in <6 months.
2. Candidate cannot do this now but likely to learn in <6 months.
3. Candidate has some experience doing this, or will be adequate in <1 month.
4. Candidate seems quite strong at this.
5. Candidate is stellar at this.

Looking for an Engineering Manager who is, or _can rapidly become_...

(note: it's impossible for one person to be a 5 on all of these. That is not the expectation. The expectation is that this rubric helps interviewers get real data so they can score 1-5 on each item instead of being wishy-washy in feedback. That said, this is an _ordered list_ - #1 is more important than, #2, #3â€¦) 

1. Extraordinary executor
    1. Has shipped reasonably complex machine learning projects on time with small teams, ideally multiple in parallel. Lives the agile mindset and iterates very quickly by interacting with stakeholders. Has scars to prove it.
    2. "In-the-weeds" when necessary, e.g. building out a new team (hiring and training) when needed, comfortable writing code to build tooling and services, pairing up with embedded ML/CV engineers to solve front line problems. Always has a pulse on how each embedded engineer's work is going and how they can help to up-level the team and it's members. 
    3. "Out-of-the-weeds" when necessary. Partners well with leadership to determine the need for and build capaity for ML and CV at Doxel. Has good nuance on over-process vs under-process. Does not micromanage, or under-manage.
    4. "Ship-it" mentality. Recognizes that perfect is the enemy is of done. Experience with startup velocity and tradeoffs. Has a knack for finding high ROI ML problems that speed up the business. Works well with stakeholders to determine what is "good enough" for ML projects. 
    5. Intuitively understands #Winning and #IncreasingCapacityToWin. Chronically discontent and wants to move faster. Focuses on impact, business-value, and continually figuring out how to move faster/build more leverage. Strong decision maker with right amount of consensus-building.

2. Top-shelf team & talent producer
    1. Builds high-performing machine learning teams. Can tell the difference between average teams and really good teams. Has 'better-than-random' approaches to building high-performing teams. Has done this multiple times (preferably >2). Philosophy agrees with what Doxel's Product and Engineering leadership wants.
    2. Talent farmer: track record of growing Sr+ engineers (bonus: Staff+ engineers). Has frameworks for identifying strengths/weaknesses, can reason about career growth intelligently, and has demonstrated wide range of tools used in growing talent. Can coach new engineering managers and get them to "great" in 6 months.
    3. Talent magnet: track record of attracting Sr+ engineers (bonus: Staff+ engineers). Can quickly identify strength of engineer + fit on the team. Excellent top-grader and can accurately paint the team, their company, and the opportunity in ways that attract candidates without setting false expectations.
    4. Can build a team from scratch (0-5 in <6 months). Understands the risks of rapid growth and has techniques to mitigate. 
    5. Bonus points if they have accomplished ^^^ with a primarily remote-first team. COVID and all...

3.  Strong technologist 
    1. Has built multiple, complex products, ideally full stack ML (data collection, curation, training, productionization and deployment, and quality control). Has either deep experience in one area or solid breadth across multiple.
    2. Knows when the difference between an easy, hard, and impossible learning task. Is able to push back or fine alte when requesta
    3. Data-driven. Knows what kind of metrics to track and how to interpret them. Makes technical decisions based off of real data. Loves building data visualizations and can use them the educate stakeholders. Bonus points for being an Edward Tufte fan. 
    4. Production expertise. Knows how to manage real ML systems in production so they have a high level of reliability and performance. Ideally has deployed and monitored a production ML system  and pays attention to performance, failure modes, improvements, etc. Product/leadership doesn't need to remind her/him to keep the product responsive.
    5. Quick learner. Can pick up new technologies, tools, etc and integrate them into their team and codebase.
